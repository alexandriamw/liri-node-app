# liri-node-app

LIRI is kind of like SIRI, but instead of speech, it interprets language to give you data. It's a command line node app you can use to find songs, concerts, and movie info. 

As this is a command line interface app, it's not deployed to GitHub pages, but you can view some screenshots below to get an idea of how it works.

## How it Works to Find Songs

On the command line, enter `node liri.js spotify-this-song '[song]'` where `[song]` is the name of the song of your choice.

Hit enter and liri displays data from the Spotify API, including song name, artist, album, and a link to listen on Spotify.
